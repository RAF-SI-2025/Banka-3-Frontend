# Banka-3-Backend

Go monorepo for the Banka 3 backend. Six gRPC services + one HTTP gateway,
shared library code in `pkg/`, proto contracts in `proto/`. Deployed on
Kubernetes; app code is k8s-ready (probes, graceful shutdown, structured
logs, env config).

The top-level memory at `/home/user/si/CLAUDE.md` has the architecture
overview and celina roadmap. This file is the backend-specific working
memory.

Generated proto stubs go into `gen/proto/<svc>v1/`. Don't commit them —
`make proto` regenerates them and CI verifies they're up-to-date.

## Services

| Service | Owns | Talks to |
|---|---|---|
| `user` | employees, clients, roles, permissions, JWT, password reset, activation tokens | notification |
| `bank` | accounts (checking + foreign), companies, cards, payments, transfers, exchange, loans, FX rates, bank's own accounts | exchange, notification |
| `trading` | listings, orders, portfolio, OTC, investment funds, capital-gains tax, SAGA orchestrator | bank, exchange, notification |
| `exchange` | exchange catalog (NYSE etc), trading hours toggle, FX rate feed | — |
| `notification` | sends emails (activation, blocked card, late installment, OTC counter-offer, …) | — |
| `gateway` | only public surface; HTTP/JSON ↔ gRPC; authn middleware; inter-bank REST endpoints | all |

Inter-service traffic is gRPC over the cluster network. Services trust the
gateway: the gateway authenticates JWT and forwards `user_id` + permissions
in gRPC metadata. Services check permissions, not roles.

## Proto + grpc-gateway

Conventions:

- One package per service per version: `proto/user/v1/user.proto` →
  `package banka.user.v1;`.
- Use `google.api.http` annotations for REST mapping. Generated REST
  routes follow `/api/v1/<resource>/...`.
- Long-running ops use server-streaming RPCs, not polling.
- Field numbers are forever — never reuse, append-only.
- `validate.proto` (buf-validate) for field validation; the gateway
  rejects bad payloads before they hit gRPC.

Codegen happens via `buf` (see `buf.gen.yaml`). Generated artifacts:

- `*.pb.go` — Go structs + gRPC clients/servers
- `*.pb.gw.go` — REST gateway
- `*.swagger.json` — OpenAPI document, copied to the frontend repo

## Database

One Postgres instance, one schema per service:

| Schema | Service | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `user` | user | `user.users`, `user.refresh_tokens`, `user.permissions` |
| `bank` | bank | `bank.accounts`, `bank.cards`, `bank.payments`, `bank.loans` |
| `trading` | trading | `trading.listings`, `trading.orders`, `trading.saga_executions` |
| `exchange` | exchange | `exchange.exchanges`, `exchange.fx_rates` |
| `notification` | notification | `notification.outbox` |

Migrations are owned per-service in `services/<svc>/migrations/` using
golang-migrate's `NNNN_name.up.sql` / `.down.sql` convention. `make migrate`
runs all pending migrations across all services in dependency order.

Cross-schema joins are forbidden by convention — services own their data.
If you need data from another service, call its gRPC API.

Queries are hand-written with `pgx` (no ORM). Each `internal/store/*.go`
file groups queries by aggregate. Use `pgx.Pool`, parameterize everything,
use `RETURNING` for inserted IDs.

## SAGA framework (`trading` service)

Each saga is a state machine persisted to `trading.saga_executions`:

```sql
create table trading.saga_executions (
  transaction_id uuid primary key,
  saga_type      text not null,           -- 'otc_settlement', 'cross_bank_payment', …
  current_step   text not null,
  state          jsonb not null,          -- per-saga payload
  status         text not null,           -- 'running' | 'compensating' | 'completed' | 'failed'
  attempts       int not null default 0,
  last_error     text,
  created_at     timestamptz not null default now(),
  updated_at     timestamptz not null default now()
);
```

A saga is defined as a sequence of `Step{Name, Forward, Compensate}`. The
orchestrator runs forward steps in order, persisting state after each. On
failure, it runs compensations in reverse for completed steps. A
background worker scans for sagas stuck in `running` past a timeout and
retries them with exponential backoff.

Step handlers must be **idempotent** keyed by `(transaction_id, step_name)`
— at-least-once delivery is assumed. The bank service's reservation /
debit / credit operations all need an idempotency key column.

## Auth

- Access token: JWT, 15min TTL, signed HS256 (key in env). Carries
  `sub` (user_id), `permissions` (string array), `iat`, `exp`.
- Refresh token: opaque random 32 bytes, 7d TTL, stored hashed in
  `user.refresh_tokens`. Web: delivered in an `httpOnly; Secure;
  SameSite=Strict` cookie scoped to `/api/v1/auth`. Mobile (login
  with `longLivedSession:true`, spec p.84): no cookie jar, so the
  gateway returns the token in the body and `RefreshHandler` accepts
  it in the body; lifetime is `JWT_MOBILE_REFRESH_TTL` (~1y). Both
  paths share one user-service flow (variadic `LoginOption`); the
  web path is byte-identical to before (response field `omitempty`).
- The gateway validates access tokens and forwards
  `x-user-id` + `x-permissions` metadata to gRPC services.
- Activation + password-reset tokens are stored in Redis with TTL
  (15 min for reset per spec).

## K8s readiness

Every service main does, in this order:

1. Parse env config (fail fast on missing required vars).
2. Initialize `slog.JSONHandler` writing to stdout. Level from
   `LOG_LEVEL` env (debug|info|warn|error, default info).
3. Open Postgres pool + Redis client. Mark `readyz` not ready until both
   ping successfully.
4. Start probe HTTP server on `PROBE_PORT` (default 8081):
   - `GET /healthz` — liveness, returns 200 if process is alive.
   - `GET /readyz` — readiness, returns 200 only when DB+Redis are up
     and gRPC server is accepting.
5. Start gRPC server on `GRPC_PORT` (default 50051) with interceptors:
   logging, recovery, metadata→context propagation.
6. Block on signal (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`). On signal: stop accepting
   new requests, drain in-flight (60s default), then close DB/Redis.

Use `pkg/probes`, `pkg/shutdown`, `pkg/grpcserver` — don't reinvent.

## Conventions

- **Errors**: return typed errors from service layer
  (`apperr.NotFound`, `apperr.Conflict`, `apperr.Validation`,
  `apperr.Permission`). gRPC interceptor maps them to status codes.
  Don't leak `pgx.ErrNoRows` past `internal/store`.
- **Logging**: `slog` only. Use `log.With("user_id", id, …)` early and
  pass the logger through context. No `fmt.Println`, no `log` stdlib.
- **Context**: every gRPC handler takes ctx; every store function takes
  ctx; every service method takes ctx. Cancel propagates.
- **Testing**: `_test.go` next to source. Integration tests against a
  real Postgres in `_integration_test.go` files (build tag
  `integration`); `make test-integration` brings up a throwaway
  Postgres via testcontainers.
- **Dependencies**: prefer stdlib. External deps need a reason. Locked
  in: `pgx/v5`, `redis/go-redis/v9`, `grpc-go`, `protobuf`,
  `grpc-gateway/v2`, `golang-migrate`, `golang-jwt`, `bufbuild/protovalidate-go`,
  `robfig/cron/v3`.
- **No god packages**. `internal/util/` is a smell — name the package
  by what it does (`internal/luhn`, `internal/iban`).

## Make targets

`make help` shows everything; common ones:

```
make proto                  # buf generate → gen/proto/
make tidy                   # go mod tidy each module (populates go.sum)
make build                  # compile all services to bin/
make up                     # postgres + redis + migrate + every service
make down                   # tear down
make migrate                # re-apply migrations (auto-runs as part of up)
make migrate-create SVC=user NAME=add_index
make seed                   # load dev fixtures
make nuke                   # down -v + up + seed
make test                   # unit tests with race detector
make test-integration
make lint                   # golangci-lint
make fmt                    # gofumpt
```

By default every toolchain target (`proto`, `migrate*`, `seed`,
`build`, `tidy`, `lint`, `fmt`, `test*`) runs inside the
`banka-tools` image (`docker/Dockerfile.tools`), exposed as the
`tools` profile-gated service in `docker-compose.yml`. The image runs
as the host UID/GID (passed via `HOST_UID`/`HOST_GID` env from the
Makefile) so anything it writes into the bind-mounted repo (gen/,
go.sum, bin/) ends up owned by the developer. The `migrate` compose
service shares the same image and is wired as a one-shot dependency
of every app service via `service_completed_successfully`, so app
services never race the migration pass.

`make HOST=1 <target>` bypasses the container and shells out to the
host toolchain directly — for devs who already have go/buf/migrate/
gofumpt/golangci-lint installed and want the lower per-command
latency.

## C4 status

c4 backend feature-complete + E2E + cascade gates green on `rewrite`.
PR8 landed two backend deliverables on top of PR1–PR7:

- *Cascade integration tests* (`services/trading/internal/service/funds_integration_test.go`):
  `TestIntegration_Cascade_ReassignFundsOnDemotion` proves
  `ReassignSupervisorAssets(from=demoted, to=actingAdmin)` flips
  every active fund managed by the demoted supervisor in one shot
  + is idempotent. `TestIntegration_Cascade_SkipsClosedFunds` proves
  closed funds stay with the prior manager (`status='active'`-only).
  Run via `make test-integration` after `make up` + `make migrate`.

- *Two real bugs surfaced + fixed* by the c4-PR8 frontend cypress
  specs:

  - `trading.otc_offers` `ListLatestOTCOffers` had an ambiguous
    `thread_id` reference between the CTE's projection and the
    outer `otc_offers o` row — every `ListOTCThreads` call 500'd
    with `column reference "thread_id" is ambiguous`. Aliased the
    CTE column as `tid` so the bare `thread_id` in the projection
    resolves unambiguously to the otc_offers row. Surfaced by
    `/banking/otc/ponude` rendering empty under live data; the
    OTC integration tests didn't exercise this path with a
    matching scan-list cycle.

  - `bank.SettleTrade`'s actuary gate rejected `KindFund` accounts
    with "aktuari mogu trgovati samo sa bankinog računa". Fund
    accounts are bank-owned (`owner_client_id = FundsOwnerID`), so
    fund-actor orders (which set `IsActuary=true`) belong in the
    same allow-list as `KindSystem` + `KindForexBook`. Without
    this the fund-actor BUY in the funds-day cypress spec
    abandoned every fill at the bank settle, and any real fund
    manager would have hit the same wall.

## C1 + C2 status

c1 and c2 are feature-complete and verified end-to-end. See top-level
`/home/user/si/CLAUDE.md` "Verification status" section for the full
breakdown.

## C3 status (backend complete, FE pending)

**Spec audit + conformance pass landed 2026-05-09** — see top-level
`CLAUDE.md` "Resolved on 2026-05-09 (c3 backend audit)" for the full
list. Headline items: stop trigger ask/bid by direction; limit fill
at min/max; margin balance/loan check; cadence formula in seconds;
USD-reference commission caps; per-order commission cap prorated
across fills; settlement-date re-check on approve; forex paired
settlement via `bank.SettleForexFill` against per-currency
`KindForexBook` accounts; clients with approved loan auto-qualify
for margin. Live stack rebuilt + `make test-integration` green.

Below: the original landing log from before the audit. Some of these
notes describe behavior that has since been corrected (e.g. the
commission-cap currency note is now obsolete); cross-reference with
the audit log when in doubt.

## C3 status (in progress, pre-audit log)

**Foundation + catalog landed (2026-05-09):**

- `services/trading/migrations/0002_c3.up.sql` — full c3 schema
  (`actuary_info`, `exchanges`, `securities`, `listings`,
  `listing_daily_price_info`, `orders`, `order_executions`,
  `portfolio_holdings`, `realized_gains`, `saga_executions`).
  Polymorphic `securities` table with type-discriminated columns +
  per-type required check constraints.
- Permissions extended: `actuary.supervisor`, `actuary.agent`,
  `trading.client`, `trading.margin`. Role bundles
  `RoleEmployeeActuarySupervisor`, `RoleEmployeeActuaryAgent`, and
  the existing `RoleClientTrading` updated.
- Proto contract `proto/trading/v1/trading.proto` defines the full c3
  surface (actuary, exchanges, securities, listings, option chain,
  orders, portfolio, tax). Generated stubs live in
  `gen/proto/trading/v1/`.
- Trading service wired into `app.go` with daily 23:59 (Belgrade)
  used-limit reset cron. Gateway dials trading and registers the
  REST handler.
- Implemented + smoke-tested via curl through the gateway:
  - actuary CRUD (`GET/PUT /api/v1/actuaries/{id}`, `PATCH .../limit`,
    `POST .../used-limit/reset`, `PATCH .../need-approval`,
    `POST /api/v1/actuaries/reset-job`),
  - exchanges (`GET/PUT /api/v1/exchanges`, `PATCH /api/v1/exchanges/{mic}/override`),
  - securities (`PUT/GET /api/v1/securities`, `GET /api/v1/securities`,
    `GET /api/v1/securities/{id}`, `GET /api/v1/securities/{stock}/option-chain`),
  - listings (`PUT /api/v1/listings`, `GET/PUT /api/v1/listings`,
    `GET /api/v1/listings/{id}/history`).
- Unit tests: actuary auth gating, market-state resolver (override,
  weekday/weekend, after-hours window), HH:MM parsing, maintenance-
  margin formula per security type, option-chain strike-window
  filter, security validation, daily-cron next-occurrence logic.

**Spec edge cases handled in this slice:**
- Spec p.38 "Admin -> supervizor" — `requireSupervisor` accepts both.
- Spec p.38 "Supervizor nema limit" — supervisors are forced to
  `daily_limit=0, need_approval=false` on upsert; updating the limit
  on a supervisor row is a `FailedPrecondition`.
- Spec p.39 "dugme koje uključuje/isključuje vreme berze" — exchange
  rows carry a tri-state `override_open` (NULL=schedule / true=forced
  open / false=forced closed); the resolver short-circuits to the
  override when set.
- Spec p.46-48 derived-data formulas (maintenance margin per type,
  initial margin cost = 1.1 × maintenance margin) computed in
  `service.computeMaintenanceMargin`.
- Spec p.56 after-hours window — within 4h of close on a weekday
  (weekend returns IsOpen=false, IsAfterHours=false).
- Spec p.58 client visibility — clients can only list stocks +
  futures; the listings/securities endpoints filter forex and option
  rows out for client principals.
- Spec p.59 option-chain strike window — `filterStrikeWindow` returns
  the N rows above + N below + the at-the-money row.

**Orders landed (2026-05-09):**

- `services/trading/internal/{store,service,server}/orders.go` — full
  CRUD: `POST /api/v1/orders`, `GET .../orders` with paging+filters,
  `GET .../orders/{id}`, `POST .../{id}/{approve,decline,cancel}`.
- Order shape validation per spec p.49-50: limit_price required for
  LIMIT/STOP_LIMIT, stop_price required for STOP/STOP_LIMIT,
  Quantity > 0, recognized direction.
- Approval routing per spec p.50: clients/supervisors/admin auto-
  approve. Agents with `need_approval=true` OR whose
  `used_limit + tradeRSD > daily_limit` go to `pending` and the
  supervisor decides via `ApproveOrder`/`DeclineOrder`. Auto-approved
  orders stamp `approved_by`/`approved_at` on insert.
- Settlement-date guard: futures/options whose `settlement_date` is
  on/before today are rejected at create time.
- Margin guard: `margin=true` requires `permissions.TradingMargin`.
- Spec p.58 client visibility: clients can't order forex/option.
- Cancellation halts further fills; sealed fills stay (spec p.50).
- `service.RateProvider` adapter dials the exchange service for
  raw bid/ask (`services/trading/internal/app/exchange_client.go`),
  used to convert foreign-currency notionals to RSD for the agent
  limit math (spec p.38).  Falls back to raw notional + warning
  when `EXCHANGE_GRPC_ADDR` is unset.
- Used-limit charge: on agent auto-approve and on supervisor approve,
  the order's RSD-equivalent gets added to `actuary_info.used_limit`
  via `Store.AddUsedLimit` inside an atomic tx.
- Last-modification audit: `last_modification` is bumped on every
  state transition (approve/decline/cancel).
- Unit tests: `validateOrderShape` (8 cases), `assertTraderRole`
  (6 cases), `tradeValueRSD` (RSD/foreign with rates / no rates).
- Smoke-tested through gateway: market+limit+stop_limit creates,
  list, get, cancel; validation rejection; auto-approval audit row.

**Execution worker + portfolio landed (2026-05-09):**

- `services/trading/internal/store/{executions,portfolio,realized_gains}.go`
  — InsertExecution, AdvanceOrderProgress, SetOrderTriggered,
  ApplyBuyFill / ApplySellFill (weighted-avg cost basis), InsertRealizedGain,
  ListExecutions / ListHoldings / ListRealizedGains.
- `services/trading/internal/service/execution.go` — partial-fill
  pipeline. ProcessOrderTick decides per-tick whether to fire one fill
  (cadence + price/limit/stop conditions); executeFill settles the
  cash leg via `TradeSettler` then atomically inserts execution +
  advances order progress + applies portfolio change + writes a
  realized_gain row on sells. RunExecutionTick walks every active
  order each worker tick.
- Cadence per spec p.56: `interval ~ Random(0, 1440 * remaining / volume)`
  minutes; +30 min for after-hours orders. Worker runs every
  `EXECUTION_TICK_INTERVAL` (default 10s); cadence math is stateless
  (rolled fresh on every tick).
- Trigger logic: STOP fires when last_price crosses `stop_price`
  (>= for buy, <= for sell); STOP_LIMIT same trigger but acts as
  Limit afterwards. `effectiveType` collapses triggered STOP→Market
  and triggered STOP_LIMIT→Limit.
- Limit conditions: buy-limit fills when ask <= limit_price; sell-limit
  fills when bid >= limit_price.
- Commission per spec p.55-56: Market = min(14% * notional, $7);
  Limit = min(24% * notional, $12). Stop / Stop-Limit follow their
  effective type post-trigger.
- AON: forces whole-order fill on the first ready tick (no random
  sub-quantity).
- `bank.SettleTrade` RPC + bank service-layer + migration extending
  `transactions.op_kind` with `'trade'`. Same-currency = single leg;
  FX hops via menjačnica engine. `is_actuary` flag zeroes FX
  commission per spec p.26. Idempotent on `op_id` (a retry returns
  the existing legs without re-charging).
- `services/trading/internal/app/bank_client.go` — TradeSettler
  adapter dials bank's SettleTrade with admin-flavored metadata
  (sentinel UUID; bank-side handler clears it before writing
  initiator_client_id so transactions.initiator_client_id stays
  NULL).
- `services/trading/internal/service/portfolio.go` + RPC handlers —
  `GET /api/v1/portfolio` (decorated holdings: current price,
  market value, profit, total profit), `PATCH .../{id}/public-count`
  (spec p.61 OTC public-count, c4-ready). Visibility: clients/agents
  see their own holdings; supervisors/admin can filter by user.
- Realized-gain RSD conversion uses the rate provider's ASK with no
  commission (spec p.62); falls back to native value when not in RSD
  and no rates are wired.
- Unit tests: `stopTriggered` (6 cases), `limitConditionMet` (5),
  `effectiveType` (6), `commissionFor` (5 — small/large for both
  Market and Limit, plus triggered StopLimit), execution-cadence
  volume math sanity.
- Smoke-tested end-to-end: market buy 2x MSFT → 2 partial fills,
  USD account debited $914.20 (= 2*$450.10 + 2*$7), portfolio
  shows weighted-avg $450.10. Then sell @ $469.90 (after price bump)
  → 2 realized_gains rows ($19.80 native, ~1994.81 RSD per share),
  portfolio quantity → 0, account credited $939.80 - $14 = $925.80.

**Capital-gains tax landed (2026-05-09):**

- `services/bank/migrations/0009_state_tax` — `accounts.kind` grows
  `'state_tax'`, `transactions.op_kind` grows `'tax'`.
- `domain.StateTaxOwnerID = 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000010`
  + `domain.KindStateTax = "state_tax"`. Bank's `EnsureSystemAccounts`
  now also seeds one RSD state-tax account ("Državni račun za porez
  na kapitalni dobitak"). Kept under a distinct kind so the
  menjačnica's `GetSystemAccount` lookups (kind='system') don't
  cross-contaminate with the tax destination.
- `bank.SettleCapitalGainsTax` RPC (internal, no http annotation) —
  takes `account_id`, `amount_rsd`, `op_id`. Bank inverts the
  menjačnica engine via `rateAndConvert(RSD → from.Currency, rsdAmt)`
  to figure out how much source-currency to pull, then calls
  `executeMoneyMove` with an actuary-flavoured initiator so the FX
  leg's commission zeroes out (spec p.62 — conversion is commission-
  free regardless of actor type). Idempotent on `op_id` via the
  existing GetTransactionsByOpID lookup.
- `services/trading/internal/store/realized_gains.go` —
  `ListTaxAggregates` (per-user sums of unpaid + paid-YTD positive
  gain_rsd) and `ListUnpaidGainsForUser`. Both clamp negative gains
  to zero per row; the simple model has no carryforward.
- `services/trading/internal/service/tax.go`:
  - `ListTaxPositions(ctx, in)` — supervisor only; returns
    `unpaid_tax_rsd = 15% × sum_unpaid_gain_rsd` and
    `paid_tax_ytd_rsd = 15% × sum_taxed_this_year_gain_rsd`.
  - `RunTax(ctx, in)` — supervisor only; with `UserID` empty walks
    every user with positive unpaid, otherwise just that one. Per
    user: groups unpaid rows by `account_id`, sums positive
    `gain_rsd` per group, debits 15% of each via
    `bank.SettleCapitalGainsTax`, then marks every row in the
    group taxed=true (loss-only groups skip the bank call but still
    get their rows consumed so the unpaid view doesn't recur).
- `app/jobs.go` — monthly tax cron at 23:55 (Europe/Belgrade) on
  the last day of each month via `nextEndOfMonthAfter` (handles
  Feb / leap years correctly). The cron's closure stamps an admin
  principal on ctx via `service.TaxCronContext` so RunTax's
  `requireSupervisor` admits the call.
- `app/bank_client.go` — `bankSettlerAdapter.SettleTax` bridges to
  the bank RPC; same admin-metadata sentinel as Settle.
- `gen/proto/trading/v1` — `ListTaxPositions` (`GET /api/v1/tax/positions`)
  + `RunTax` (`POST /api/v1/tax/run`) handlers wired in
  `services/trading/internal/server/tax.go`.
- Tests: `taxRate=0.15` constant pin, `TaxCronContext` admin stamp,
  RunTax + ListTaxPositions auth gates (client → 403),
  `nextEndOfMonthAfter` table (mid-month / past-slot rollover /
  Feb non-leap / Feb leap).
- Smoke-tested through gateway: realized_gains seeded by the c3
  execution-worker smoke (2 rows, gain_rsd ≈ 1994.81 each).
  `GET /tax/positions` returned `unpaid_tax_rsd=598.4437`,
  `paid_tax_ytd_rsd=0`. `POST /tax/run` returned
  `users_taxed=1, total_collected_rsd=598.4437`. Two ledger legs
  written: USD 5.94 (user→bank house) and RSD 598.4437 (bank
  house→state). State-tax balance went from 0 → 598.4437; both
  realized_gains rows flipped to `taxed=true` with the same
  `tax_op_id`. Second run-tax was a no-op
  (`users_taxed=0, total_collected_rsd=0`).

**c3 bootstrap landed (2026-05-09):**

- `services/user/cmd/seed/main.go` extended with `seedTrading`. Plants
  on every `make seed` (idempotent throughout):
  - USD personal_fx trading account ("Trgovinski USD") on the seeded
    klijent, opening balance 300000 USD. Match-by-currency-and-kind so
    a hand-rolled USD account survives.
  - Two dedicated trading employees (separate from banking-only
    `zaposleni@banka.local`): `aktuar@banka.local` (Aktuar123!) gets
    RoleEmployeeAgent + RoleEmployeeActuaryAgent perms and an
    `actuary_info` row (type=agent, daily_limit=200000 RSD,
    need_approval=false); `supervizor@banka.local` (Supervizor123!)
    gets RoleEmployeeAgent + RoleEmployeeActuarySupervisor (incl.
    `trading.margin`) and an `actuary_info` row (type=supervisor,
    daily_limit=0 to mirror the spec p.38 "supervizor nema limit"
    invariant the service enforces on upsert). zaposleni stays
    banking-only so each of the three employee profiles has a
    distinct fixture. Idempotent: SELECT-then-INSERT for the user
    row + on-conflict-do-nothing for `actuary_info`.
  - Three exchanges: XNYS (NYSE / USD / America/New_York / 09:30-16:00),
    XLON (LSE / GBP / Europe/London / 08:00-16:30), XBEL (BELEX / RSD /
    Europe/Belgrade / 09:30-14:00). on-conflict (mic) do nothing.
  - Stocks: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL on XNYS; VOD on XLON; NIS on XBEL — each
    with a listing. Helper closure inserts both rows; on-conflict
    (ticker, type) do update returns existing id so listings dedupe via
    on-conflict (security_id) do nothing.
  - One future (CL / Crude Oil WTI on XNYS / +90d settlement, with
    listing), one forex pair (EURUSD with optional listing), one option
    (AAPL-C-190 / call / strike 190 / +60d expiry, no listing — service
    reads premium off the security row).
- `seedClient` augments existing rows with `trading.client` so a c2
  klijent that pre-dates c3 picks up trading capability on the next
  seed run; new clients already include it. Same idempotent
  array_agg(distinct …) pattern.
- `.env.example` documents `EXECUTION_TICK_INTERVAL` (default 10s) +
  `FX_COMMISSION` (default 0.005).
- `Makefile`'s `test-integration` now also runs services/bank's
  integration suite (was user-only).

Smoke-test of seed end-to-end on the live dev DB: `make seed` ran twice
back-to-back, both runs reached "trading fixtures created" without
error or duplicate. Re-login as `klijent@banka.local` returned a JWT
with `trading.client` in the perms. `GET /api/v1/listings` as the
client returned the seeded stocks + future (forex/option correctly
filtered out per spec p.58); same endpoint as the agent additionally
returned the forex row. `make test` and `make test-integration` both
green.

**c1**: user service — auth (login/refresh/logout), employee CRUD,
activation, password reset, session_version revocation, JWT middleware
in gateway.

**c2**: bank service — companies + authorized persons; accounts (RSD
+ FX, personal + business) with per-spec maintenance fees, default
limits, and `UpdateAccountName` for spec p.20 rename popup; cards
(lifecycle + per-account limit; CVV digest is HMAC-SHA256 with
`BANK_CVV_PEPPER`, never argon2id); payments (same-currency + FX
through bank house, ASK on every leg per spec p.26); transfers;
menjačnica (quote + execute); payment recipients; loans (request →
approve → installment cron → variable-rate refresh). Bank emits
Serbian notifications via a `Notifier` interface (email through
`pkg/email`; `UserResolver` dials user-service GetClient with
internal admin metadata to fetch the recipient address).

**Verification primitive** (`pkg/verification`, gateway middleware):
spec p.11 verifikacioni-kod gates payments / transfers / limit
changes / card issuance. Redis-keyed, 6-digit, 5-min TTL, 3 wrong
attempts retire the record. The web flow returns the code in the
`/verification/request` response so the FE renders it inline (dev
mode — unchanged). The mobile app (spec p.84) instead polls
`GET /api/v1/verification/pending` (additive; `pkg/verification`
keeps a per-user index, gateway type-asserts the optional
`PendingLister`) and shows the code on the phone for the user to type
back on the web. Do NOT remove the web in-body code — Cypress depends
on it.

**Tests**: bank service ~50 (`integration` build tag for ~33 of them),
user service ~30 integration, gateway middleware suites (auth +
idempotency + verification), pkg/* unit suites (account, auth, card,
cvv, idempotency, loans, money, passwords, permissions, verification)
all green.

Next steps:
- Begin celina 3 (`trading` service: listings, orders, portfolio, OTC,
  capital-gains tax, SAGA orchestrator). Read spec section "Trgovina
  hartijama sa berze" before starting.

## Locked decisions for c1

- **Password hashing**: argon2id (OWASP default), parameters in
  `pkg/passwords`.
- **Email in dev**: notification service uses real SMTP if `SMTP_HOST`
  is set; otherwise it logs full email content to stdout. One code
  path, env-driven.
- **Session revocation**: JWT carries a `sv` (session_version) claim.
  Each user has a `session_version` int column. Gateway middleware
  reads `usv:{kind}:{id}` from Redis on every request and rejects
  tokens with stale `sv`. On deactivation: increment user's
  `session_version`, write to Redis, revoke refresh tokens.
- **Permissions** are dot-namespaced strings, frozen in
  `pkg/permissions/permissions.go`. C1 set:
  `admin`, `employee.read`, `employee.write`, `client.read`,
  `client.write`, `permission.grant`. Subsequent celine append, never
  rename.
- **Activation token TTL**: 24h.
- **Reset token TTL**: 15min (per spec).
- **Lockout policy**: not implemented. Spec p.10 marks it
  "za nadogradnju" — explicitly deferred. Don't add a counter without
  a spec change.
- **Card CVV hashing**: HMAC-SHA256 keyed by `BANK_CVV_PEPPER`
  (`pkg/cvv`). Argon2id is wrong here — the search space is 1000 keys,
  so per-guess work factor is meaningless. The pepper makes a stolen
  database alone insufficient to recover any CVV.
- **FX rate direction**: spec p.26 ("uvek prodajni kurs") — always use
  the ASK column on every leg of a conversion, even when the bank is
  buying foreign. The bank's profit comes from the commission, not
  the bid/ask spread. `services/bank/.../exchange_quote.go` and
  `loans.go` (bracket-lookup) follow this; the BID column the
  exchange service stores is reserved for future use.
- **Notification service**: c1 + c2 emit emails directly via
  `pkg/email` through service-local `Notifier` adapters (user service
  for activation / reset / profile change; bank service for card
  status / loan decisions / missed installments). The standalone
  `notification` service is still a stub. Centralizing all email
  through it is deferred until c4 OTC counter-offers — when there are
  ~10+ event types the duplication of Serbian email templating across
  services becomes annoying enough to justify the migration. When
  that happens, both services swap their `notifierAdapter` for a
  notification gRPC client; service layers don't change.

Each celina's spec edge cases are documented in the top-level
`/home/user/si/CLAUDE.md`. Re-read before starting work in that area.
